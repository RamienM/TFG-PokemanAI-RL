# TFG-PokemonRed
Final Degree Project for the Computer Engineering program at the University of the Balearic Islands. This TFG is based on and adapted from the PokemonRedExperiments project by PWhiddy on GitHub. It consists of an adaptation where a segmentation model is applied so that the agent can interpret the environment information in a simple way.
